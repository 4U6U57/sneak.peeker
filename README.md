Command line utility that generates a set of probable questions that will be asked on a future exam given a sample set of *test files* (plaintext) and the lexicographic list of the words that will appear on the future test (the output of the `sneak.peek.sh` script).

This program is almost uniquely useful for those taking classes taught by *Wesley Mackey* at **UCSC**.

## Installation

This project is not yet released, please do not try to install it.

## Usage

Specific instructions can be found by running `sneak.peeker --help`.

## Motivation

This program has been specifically written as an antithesis to Mackey.

- It's written in *Python*, a popular alternative to Mackey's language of choice, *Perl*
- Its structure is modeled after *Git*, a popular alternative to Mackey's version control system of choice, *Subversion*
- It's also version controlled with *Git*, of course
- Its documentation is easy to follow, as opposed to the majority of Mackey's PDFs
- Its codebase is encapsulated into a single file, as opposed to scattered across multiple files and directories, such as Mackey's assignments
- It's also likely to improve your grade, as opposed to most of Mackey's assignments
